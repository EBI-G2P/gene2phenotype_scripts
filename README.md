# Gene2Phenotype (G2P) scripts

The Gene2Phenotype scripts repo provides a set of scripts to add, delete or update G2P data.

It is part of the Gene2Phenotype project, established by David FitzPatrick in 2012 with the aim of accelerating the diagnosis of children with developmental disorders. In 2014, the database moved from the University of Edinburgh to EMBL-EBI and a dedicated website was launched to improve data accessibility. G2P has been generalised to cover other disease areas and extended to capture additional information to provide a more detailed understanding of disease mechanism.
